Instructions:

1) Make sure mongo is running in the background
2) Open terminal and go to the correct directory
3) type npm install MongoDB in the terminal. Install all packages needed for the server to work such as pug and express
4) start the database by typing node database-initializer.js
5) start the server by typing node server.js


I have broken my code down to a server.js and a database-initializer.js. I then have two folder: the vendors folder containing the three JSON files given to us and a views file containing all 5 pug pages and three javascript pages each with a specific functionality.


I tried running it on the server but it told me i still needed to download the modules. I am still confused if it's my mistake or am I doing it wrong. 


Overview:

This  web app is a platform for multiple vendors to sell their items. Each vendor has their own list of items that they offer, and these items are displayed on the vendor's supply page. Customers can browse the different vendors and view the items they have available for sale.

The web app includes a welcome home page that greets customers and provides an overview of the available vendors and their items. Customers can also access the items page for each item within a vendor, which includes a rating system. This allows customers to see the quality and popularity of the items before making a purchase.

In addition to browsing and purchasing items, the web app also includes functionality for vendors to add new vendors and new items to their list. They can also put items on sale or add bulk stock to their inventory.

The web app is built using a variety of technologies, including MongoDB for the database, Pug, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, and Node and Express for the backend. These technologies work together to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for both vendors and customers.
